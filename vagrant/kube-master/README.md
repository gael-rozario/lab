# kubemaster

kubemaster is a vm which is created in my one of my local machine using kvm and libvirt 

Inorder to keep the setup straight forward i have used Vagrant along with libvirt plugin to create this vm

- vm using kvm libvirt
- spun up using vagrant with libvirt plugin
- packaged a vagrant box using qcow image from talos linux
- configured network using bridge network using local router dhcp
